# TaskQueuePro Branding Prompts

**For DALL-E 3 Image Generation**

These prompts generate consistent branding for TaskQueuePro following the Beacon HQ Visual System v1.

---

## PROMPT 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

```
Create a title card image with a 16:9 aspect ratio in a professional tech style with a dark background (#0a0e27 navy). 

The main visual should feature an organized, glowing task board or queue visualization with priority levels indicated by different colors (red for critical, orange for high, blue for normal, green for low). Show tasks flowing through a pipeline or organized in columns, with subtle circuit patterns connecting them.

Include the text "TaskQueuePro" in a modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Inter) in bright cyan (#00d4ff), positioned in the lower third. Add the tagline "Self-Scheduling Task Management" in smaller white text below it.

Use a color palette of navy blue (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white (#ffffff), and accent colors for priorities (red #ff4444, orange #ff8c42, green #4ade80). Add subtle tech elements like glowing nodes, connection lines, and a slight grid pattern overlay.

The overall mood should be organized, intelligent, and automated - conveying efficient workflow management.

## PROMPT 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

```
Create a square logo icon for a task management system called TaskQueuePro.

The design should feature a stylized checklist or task board icon with priority indicators. Use a dark navy circle (#0a0e27) as the background. In the center, show a minimalist representation of organized tasks - perhaps stacked horizontal lines with checkboxes, colored dots for priorities, or a queue symbol with items flowing through.

Use bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the main icon elements, with small accent colors for priorities (red, orange, blue, green dots or indicators). Add a subtle glow effect around the icon.

The style should be modern, clean, and tech-forward - suitable for a professional developer tool. No text in this version - icon only.
```

## PROMPT 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

```
Create a wide horizontal logo banner (3:1 aspect ratio) for TaskQueuePro.

On the left third, include a stylized icon of a task queue or organized checklist with priority indicators (small colored dots or bars in red, orange, blue, green).

In the center and right sections, display "TaskQueuePro" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Space Grotesk) in bright cyan (#00d4ff).

Use a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle tech elements like circuit patterns, connection lines, or a faint grid. The icon should have a slight glow effect in cyan.

Below or integrated with the text, add small priority indicators or a subtle workflow pipeline visual to reinforce the "task management" concept.

Professional, clean, tech-forward style suitable for GitHub headers and documentation.
```

## PROMPT 4: App Icon (1:1 Square, Simplified)

```
Create a simple, bold app icon (1:1 square) for TaskQueuePro that works at small sizes.

Design a minimalist icon featuring a checklist or task queue symbol. Use a dark navy (#0a0e27) to bright cyan (#00d4ff) gradient as the background. The main symbol should be a simple, geometric representation of tasks - perhaps three horizontal lines with checkboxes or priority dots on the left.

Use white for the main icon elements with small accent dots in priority colors (red, orange, green) next to the task lines.

Keep it very simple and bold - it should be recognizable even at 32x32 pixels. Modern, flat design style with subtle depth (maybe a slight shadow or gradient).

No text - icon only. Clean, professional, instantly recognizable as a task management tool.
```
